I. Why?
For as long as I can remember, I have been seeing people complaining about the "overpowered" or "underpowered" items that are present in the offical release of Baldur's Gate II.  I decided to fix those complaints while teaching myself to modify items in the Infinity Engine at the same time.  "Rastor's Item Pack" was the result of my playing around.

Over the years, the modding community has gone through a veritable revolution.  During that time, IEEP (once the standard) was rendered obsolete, WeiDU went through a number of advances, and the standards expected from the modding community in general vastly improved.  Unfortunately, this pack did not evolve with the community.  It remained the old collection of a dozen items or so that I had whipped up on an early release of IEEP in 2001, until now.

The name of the mod has been changed to reflect the contributions of the modding community and players although the nostalgic core of the mod is still present.  Enjoy!

II. Installation Instructions
If you're installing to a PC, the procedure for installation is relatively painless.  Simply download the self-extracting archive to your hard drive and run.  The installer will automatically set itself to your BG2 directory.  If this is not the location to which you want to install (you're running more than one installation for instance), then simply change the path to your BG2 directory (MUST contain dialog.tlk and chitin.key!) and run.  The mod will be automatically installed for you, simply answer any questions that pop up.

To install to a Mac, download the zip file and extract it to your main BG2 directory (must contain dialog.tlk and chitin.key).  After extracting, run setup-RItemPack and answer any questions that appear in the WeiDU window.

III. Uninstallation
Regardless of whether you're running a PC or Mac, run setup-RItemPack in your BG2 directory and choose to uninstall the mod.
